        <h1> WELCOME TO AYODHYA</h1>
        <p>Ayodhya, located on the banks of the Sarayu River in Uttar Pradesh, is one of the most sacred cities in
             India and holds immense religious and historical importance. It is widely revered as the birthplace of Lord Rama, 
             the seventh incarnation of Lord Vishnu, and serves as a central setting in the ancient Hindu epic Ramayana. 
             Historically known as Saketa, Ayodhya was the capital of the ancient Kosala kingdom and is recognized as one of the seven most 
             sacred cities (Sapta Puri) in Hinduism. The city is home to the grand Shri Ram Janmabhoomi Temple, 
             recently constructed at the site believed to be Lord Ramaâ€™s birthplace, attracting millions of devotees and tourists from around the world. 
             Besides the Ram Temple, Ayodhya also features other spiritual landmarks such as Hanuman Garhi, Kanak Bhavan, and numerous ghats along the 
             Sarayu River where pilgrims perform holy rituals. Blending mythology with modern development, Ayodhya has transformed into a major spiritual and 
             cultural destination while preserving its ancient heritage. The best time to visit is between October and March when the weather is pleasant,
             making it ideal for exploring the temples, festivals, and serene riverfronts that define this timeless city.</p>
