        <h1> WELCOME TO ARUNACHALAM</h1>
        <p>Arunachalam, also known as Arunachala Hill, is a sacred mountain located in Tiruvannamalai, 
            Tamil Nadu, and is one of the most revered spiritual sites in South India. At its base lies the Arunachalesvara Temple,
             dedicated to Lord Shiva, who is worshipped here in the form of fire — one of the five elements in the Pancha Bhoota Sthalams. According to Hindu mythology, Lord Shiva manifested as an endless column of fire at this very place to show his supremacy over Lord Vishnu and Lord Brahma. The hill itself is considered a physical embodiment of Lord Shiva, and devotees often perform the holy Giri 
            Pradakshina — a 14 km circumambulation of the hill, especially during full-moon nights.
The Arunachalesvara Temple is an architectural marvel with tall gopurams (towers), expansive courtyards, 
and intricately carved halls that reflect the artistry of the Chola, Vijayanagara, and Nayaka dynasties. 
The temple comes alive during major festivals like Karthigai Deepam, when a massive flame is lit atop the hill, 
symbolizing the eternal light of Shiva. Apart from its religious significance, Arunachalam is also known as a powerful spiritual center — sages 
like Sri Ramana Maharshi meditated here, drawing seekers of truth and peace from around the world. The serene environment, ancient legends, 
and deep spiritual energy make Arunachalam not just a temple town but a timeless symbol of divine light and inner awakening.</p>
