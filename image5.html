        <h1> WELCOME TO ARUNACHALAM</h1>
        <p>Kedarnath Temple, situated in the Garhwal Himalayas of Uttarakhand at an altitude of about 3,583 meters near the Mandakini River,
             is one of the most revered shrines of Lord Shiva. It is one of the twelve Jyotirlingas and forms a key part of the sacred Char Dham Yatra,
              along with Yamunotri, Gangotri, and Badrinath. According to Hindu mythology, the Pandavas from the Mahabharata sought Lord Shiva’s blessings
               here to atone for their sins after the Kurukshetra war. The temple is believed to have been revived by Adi Shankaracharya in the 8th century, although the site itself is much older. Architecturally, the temple is built from massive stone slabs in a traditional North Indian (Nagara) style, with a tall conical spire and a sanctum housing a naturally formed conical Shiva lingam believed to represent the hump of Lord Shiva’s bull form. Due to its high altitude, the temple remains open only from April/May to October/November each year, after which the idol is shifted to the Omkareshwar Temple in Ukhimath for winter worship. Pilgrims usually reach Kedarnath by trekking 16–17 km from Gaurikund or by helicopter services when available. Despite being struck by natural calamities, including the 2013 floods, 
               the temple has miraculously withstood time and nature, symbolizing resilience and faith. 
            The best time to visit is during May–June and September–October, when weather conditions are favorable for the journey.</p>
